# RabbitMQ-WebApi-Wrapper
HTTP API wrapper library for RabbitMQ's management plugin. Done for C#.

This is a small library that I made to wrap the HTTP api funcitonality of RabbitMQ's server in version 3.6.6.

I used this library to retrieve information about the actual server/cluster status since I did not find any way to do it from the
RabbitMQ.Client library.
